# codesynth

A small draftpouch of code generation synergy.

> generate.py has a draft of a single class interface that can be used now with ai21, genji, or openai.  There's also a hack here for an rpc server and client to run it on a remote system with the same interface, or to keep genji live in memory across different processes for speed.  Using genji requires the git-lfs dance and `git submodule update --init`
